//  Compound Assignment Operators: Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using compound operators.

let x = 4;
console.log(x); // initial value 4
x += 3; // add 3 in 4
console.log(x); // become 7
x -= 3; // sub 3 in 7
console.log(x); // become 4
x *= 3; // multiply by 3
console.log(x); // become 12
x /= 3; // divide by 3
console.log(x); // become 4
